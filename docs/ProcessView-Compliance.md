# Process View compliance check

I’ll verify your Process View requirements against the current app behavior without changing any code, and call out what’s fully covered versus what’s only partially covered.

## Activity: Shelter Intake & Vet Check
- Coverage: Partially met at runtime; fully representable in architecture.
- Evidence in code/data:
  - Intake/creation: Pets can be created (e.g., via appointment booking flow or emergency intake in `handleEmergencyDispatch`).
  - Vet check scheduling: Facilities and `facility_slots` support scheduled vet checks; appointments are persisted in `appointments`.
  - Stability decision + emergency path: Emergency cases are handled via `handleEmergencyDispatch` (creates a pet, routes to vet, books earliest slot; description is “EMERGENCY DISPATCH”).
  - Recording findings: Health info can be captured in `pets.medicalHistory` and `journal_entries` (date, title, note).
  - Notifications/logging: The UI uses JavaFX `Alert` dialogs (immediate user-facing notifications). Activity logging is represented by persisted records: `appointments`, `journal_entries`, and fields on `pets`.
- Notes: There isn’t a dedicated “intake form” screen for shelters; however, intake is demonstrable via emergency intake and standard appointment creation, and the schema supports storing the same outcomes (profile, findings, logs).

## Sequence: Vaccination Reminder Workflow
- Coverage: Conceptually supported; partially met in the current runtime.
- Evidence in code/data:
  - Relevant data present: `pets`, `pet_medications`, and `journal_entries`.
  - UI notification mechanism: JavaFX `Alert` can show reminders.
- Gap: There’s no background scheduler or explicit “NotificationService” currently querying for due vaccinations and pushing reminders to a dashboard/user automatically.
- Conclusion: The architecture and data model support this; the runtime “auto reminder” behavior is not implemented yet (would require a small scheduling component to query due dates and display a notification).

## Collaboration: Appointment Scheduling
- Coverage: Met.
- Evidence in code/data:
  - Scheduling component: `handleBookAppointment` queries open `facility_slots` (availability), lets the user choose, and calls `addAppointment(...)`.
  - Availability service: `facility_slots` is queried/updated (`booked` flag).
  - Profile/medical history: Pet is linked via `petId`; medical data lives in `pets` and `journal_entries` and can be associated to the visit.
  - Staff/facility assignment: Facilities are represented in `facilities` and linked by `facilityId`.
  - Result return: Confirmation to the user via `Alert`; persistence in `appointments` and slot state change.

## Sequence: Routine Scheduling & Emergency Dispatch
- Coverage: Met.
- Evidence in code/data:
  - Routine scheduling: `handleBookAppointment` (time-ordered dialog → select slot → confirm → persist).
  - Emergency dispatch: `handleEmergencyDispatch` (intake → route vet facility → select/create earliest slot → book appointment → confirm).
  - Notifications: User-facing confirmations via JavaFX `Alert`.
  - Result persistence: `appointments` updated; `facility_slots.booked` set; emergency labeled via `description`.

## Summary and status
- Fully met at runtime:
  - Appointment scheduling (collaboration and sequence views).
  - Emergency dispatch (sequence view).
- Partially met at runtime (fully covered conceptually/architecturally):
  - Shelter intake & vet check activity: Implemented via existing flows and data; no dedicated intake form UI. Findings and logging are supported through `pets` and `journal_entries`.
  - Vaccination reminders sequence: Data and UI exist, but there’s no automated reminder scheduler yet (no code changes made per your instruction).

No code changes were made. If later you want “NotificationService sends a reminder for user” implemented end-to-end, the smallest, low-risk addition would be:
- Add a lightweight scheduler that periodically queries for upcoming due vaccinations (based on `pet_medications` or journal entries) and calls `Platform.runLater` to show a reminder. This can be disabled/enabled at login and would not change your existing flows.

If you’d like, I can produce a short architectural note mapping each figure (3–6) to the concrete classes, tables, and UI actions in your codebase for your documentation package—without modifying the application.
